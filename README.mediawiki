=SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION CALCULATOR=

'''This is a simple mathematical expresion calculator.'''

* Feature:
*# Has its own built-in arithmetic functions, which can calculate very big numbers (hundreds of digits).
*# Uses stack-based mathematical expression parsing method (which is simple and fast).

For now, the program's still not perfect yet due to its weak memory control. Will fix it as fast as I can.
