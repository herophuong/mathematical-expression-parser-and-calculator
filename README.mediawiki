=SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION CALCULATOR=

'''This is a simple mathematical expresion calculator.'''

* Feature:
*# Has its own built-in arithmetic functions, which can calculate very big numbers.
*# Uses stack-based mathematical expression parsing method (which is simple and fast).
*# Uses strict rules to validate mathematical expressions (prevent crashes).

* Supported elements in the expression:
*# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
*# Parentheses: (, ) 
*# Numbers (of course)

* Note:
*# The program's division is integer's division.
